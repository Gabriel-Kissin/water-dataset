# water-dataset

The idea of this notebook is to create a simple classification dataset as an alternative to iris and penguins.  

The classes are fresh water types (river, lake, estuary etc). Various features are included in the dataset (e.g. oxygen and nitrate content in the sample), which can act as the basis for classification.
